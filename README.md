# Project-_Recipe_App-Mercedes_Maier-Solution-2
This project was created to show the use of different components with rendering and state management using React. 
The app will allow a user to add new recipes, display a list of recipes and delete a recipe from the list by 
clicking a delete button. You will also be asked to add styling as provided in the mockup.

The app will display a recipe's name, cuisine, photo, ingredients, preparation instructions and action buttons (delete).
You should create at least one additional component that is used by the RecipeList component.
The app does not need to match the exact appearance of the mockup, but should be similar and pass the styling tests.
You should add handlers and other attributes to the starter code as needed.
